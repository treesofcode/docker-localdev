This is my attempt at creating an automated solution for building local web
servers using docker. To create a new site, you just need to change the service
name, container name, port number, and folder name. This is usually done using
version numbers (website1, website2, website3) for simplicity and organization.
What is nice is that this can be done pretty much indefinitely up to hundreds of sites.
In the near future i'd like to find a way to automate that process as well, but
 until now this is much quicker than the alternatives.
